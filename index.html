            An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being
            called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The
            Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he
            prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity and they seek
            to destroy his life. He taketh three days’ journey into the
            wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth
            to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The account
            of their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife.
            They take their families and depart into the wilderness. Their
            sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their
            travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel
            against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call the
            name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the
            promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of
            Nephi; or in other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.

            Nephi begins the record of his people—Lehi sees in vision a pillar
            of fire and reads from a book of prophecy—He praises God, foretells
            the coming of the Messiah, and prophesies the destruction of
            Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the Jews. About 600&nbsp;<small
