            An invitation is given to enter into the rest of the Lord—Pray with
            real intent—The Spirit of Christ enables men to know good from
            evil—Satan persuades men to deny Christ and do evil—The prophets
            manifest the coming of Christ—By faith, miracles are wrought and
            angels minister—Men should hope for eternal life and cleave unto
            charity. About <small>A.D.</small>&nbsp;401–21.
